Hello again! This is my super janky landing page. I wasn't very confident going into this project because I didn't feel 100% comfortable with flexbox yet, but once I actually starting working I realized how much I actually learned. The flex exercises turned about to be a huge boon for my understanding, and I frequently pulled from them to help figure out the layout/s for this project. The text/content could definitely be better (I used my own photos of my own animals), but I'm proud of the layout that I somehow managed to make. Super excited for what comes next!
